            Hi there! Iâ€™m Brandon Maul, a software engineer based in Buffalo, NY.
            My adventure in the tech world began when I was only just a kid (<a href="jr-dev.jpeg" class="photo" alt="a young brandon playing on the computer" target="_blank">really</a>) and has since evolved into a career marked by versatility, hard work, and a profound appreciation for the art of software development. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Specializing in the Swift programming language and deeply engaged within Apple's ecosystem, I've dedicated myself to crafting intuitive, reliable apps that seamlessly integrate into daily life.
            Beyond my expertise in app development, my tenure at companies such as @Andium and @Moog have honed my skills in full-stack engineering, distributed cloud computing, and IoT solutions.
        </p>
        <p>
            The journey so far has not only expanded my technical knowledge, but has also refined my ability to lead teams, mentor new engineers, and architect solutions that meet rigorous performance and accessibility standards.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether itâ€™s bringing IoT devices to life, constructing innovative cloud solutions, or just putting another square on your home screen, my goal is to build software thatâ€™s not just functional - but also meaningful.
        </p>
