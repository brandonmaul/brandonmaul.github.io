            Hi there! Iâ€™m Brandon Maul, a software engineer based in Buffalo, NY. Thanks for visiting my website! Please allow me to tell you little about myself...
        </p>

        <p>
            My adventure in the tech world began when I was only just a kid (<a href="jr-dev.jpeg" class="photo" alt="a young brandon playing on the computer" target="_blank">really</a>) and has since evolved into a career marked by versatility, hard work, and a profound appreciation for the art of software development. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The journey so far has given me experience in architecting scalable cloud solutions, embedded IoT software, and platform-focused native apps that are reliable, performant, and secure.
        </p>

        <p>
            Specializing in the Swift programming language and possessing a deep understanding of Apple's platforms, I currently spend my days building iOS/iPadOS apps for Andium Inc. However, my passion for software engineering extends beyond that of iOS development.
        </p>

        <p>
            As a full-stack engineer, I've built and architected a massive telemetry processing pipeline for IoT devices. I was able to actually work on the solution on nearly ever level, from the IoT devices themselves to the storage and machine-learning services in Azure. Experience with spinning up ASP.NET APIs, managing multi-region Azure networking infrastructure with Terraform/ARM Templates, and building customized authorization SDKs are just some of the skills I've aquired from this work.
            I've utilized containerizaiton with Podman or Docker, to ensure that the tools I build can be deployed anywhere. And of course K8s or Openstack to expand and scale.
        </p>

        <p>
            I've also had the honor to lead full development teams, hire new engineers, and mentor junior developers in their software engineering career. When given the responsibility to teach others, I find I learn a lot myself.
        </p>

        <p>
            I have fundamental understanding of what it means to write organized codebases, ensured with memory-safe, type-safe code. I'm a dedicated student of anything relating to computation or linguistics, and spend a considerable amount of my free time continuing to educate myself with new tools, techniques, and ideologies in those fields.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you've made it this far, thanks for reading! If you'd like to chat, I'm on Mastodon. If you'd like to inquire about business or mentorship opporunties you can email me here:
